Project Title: Zomato Restaurant Data Analysis: Uncovering Dining Trends
1. Abstract
This project performs a comprehensive analysis of the Zomato dataset to uncover key patterns and insights about the restaurant landscape. Zomato, as a leading food discovery and delivery platform, generates a vast amount of data that can be used to understand customer preferences, restaurant performance, and market dynamics. The primary objective is to explore factors that influence a restaurant's success, such as location, cuisine, cost, and customer ratings. The analysis involves data cleaning, exploratory data analysis (EDA), and data visualization to derive actionable insights for restaurateurs, customers, and Zomato itself.

2. Dataset
The dataset used is a rich collection of restaurant information scraped from the Zomato website, typically focusing on a major city like Bangalore. It contains approximately 50,000+ restaurant entries with various features (columns), including:

name: Name of the restaurant

online_order: Whether the restaurant accepts online orders

book_table: Whether the restaurant allows table booking

rate: The overall customer rating (out of 5)

votes: The number of ratings received

location: The neighborhood where the restaurant is located

rest_type: The type of restaurant (e.g., Casual Dining, Quick Bites)

cuisines: The cuisines offered

approx_cost(for two people): The approximate cost for a meal for two

listed_in(type): The meal type (e.g., Buffet, Dine-out)

3. Key Objectives & Questions
This analysis aims to answer several key business questions:

Market Distribution: What is the distribution of restaurants across different locations and types (e.g., Casual Dining vs. Quick Bites)?

Popular Cuisines: Which cuisines are the most popular or most widely available in the city?

Cost vs. Rating: Is there a significant relationship between the cost of a meal and the restaurant's rating? Do expensive restaurants guarantee better ratings?

Impact of Services: How do services like online ordering and table booking affect a restaurant's rating and popularity (number of votes)?

Geospatial Analysis: Which locations are hotspots for top-rated or budget-friendly restaurants?

Predictive Insights (Optional): Can we build a model to predict a restaurant's rating based on its features (cuisine, cost, location, etc.)?

4. Methodology & Workflow
Data Cleaning & Preprocessing:

Handled missing values in critical columns like rate, approx_cost, and cuisines using appropriate methods (e.g., dropping, imputation with mean/median).

Cleaned and standardized the rate column (e.g., changing 'NEW' or '-' to NaN and converting '4.1/5' to a numeric value 4.1).

Converted the approx_cost column from a string (e.g., 'â‚¹1,200') to a numeric data type.

Standardized the rest_type and cuisines columns for consistency.

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):

Performed univariate analysis to understand the distribution of individual variables like ratings, cost, and restaurant types using histograms and count plots.

Conducted bivariate analysis to explore relationships between variables, such as rate vs. approx_cost (scatter plot) and online_order vs. rate (box plot).

Used bar charts to visualize the top 10 most popular cuisines and locations with the highest concentration of restaurants.

Created heatmaps to visualize the correlation between numeric features.

Data Visualization:

Utilized libraries like Matplotlib and Seaborn to create static charts and graphs for analysis.

(Optional) Employed Plotly for interactive visualizations or Folium for geospatial mapping of restaurant locations.

5. Tools and Technologies Used
Programming Language: Python

Libraries for Data Manipulation & Analysis: Pandas, NumPy

Libraries for Data Visualization: Matplotlib, Seaborn

(Optional) Machine Learning: Scikit-learn (for predictive modeling)

(Optional) Interactive Plots: Plotly, Folium

Environment: Jupyter Notebook / Google Colab

6. Potential Insights & Findings
The majority of restaurants fall under the "Quick Bites" category, indicating a high demand for fast and casual dining options.

Cuisines like North Indian and Chinese are the most prevalent across the city.

A weak positive correlation exists between cost and rating, suggesting that higher price doesn't necessarily equate to higher quality.

Restaurants offering online ordering and table booking services tend to have significantly higher ratings and receive more votes on average.

Locations like Koramangala and BTM Layout emerge as major food hubs with a dense concentration of diverse restaurants.

7. Conclusion & Future Scope
This project provides a foundational understanding of the factors driving the restaurant business on Zomato. The insights can help new restaurant owners make informed decisions about location, cuisine, and pricing. For future work, the analysis could be extended by:

Performing sentiment analysis on user reviews to gain deeper insights into customer satisfaction.

Building a more robust predictive model for restaurant success.

Developing a restaurant recommendation system based on user preferences.
